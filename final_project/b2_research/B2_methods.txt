A hand search was made for complete journal volumes from various sources that included the Sir Albert Cook Library which is the main MakCHS library, personal collections and the journal editorial teams’ files. For each article found, the following information was captured; the articles’ authors and their affiliations, the use of the IMRAD format of writing papers, the composition of the authoring teams and the year of the publication. The data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences Inc. (version 12.0 for Windows, Chicago, Illinois) with the calculation of odd ratios and trend analysis being made with the aid of online Open Epi programme version 2.3.1 http://www. openepi.com [15]. The results were summarised as frequencies and presented in bar graphs and tables with calculation of odds ratios, effect sizes and trend analysis. Additional inferences were made with the aid of spearman’s correlations and non parametric tests with the level of significance set as P value of less than 0.05.
Permission to use the data for this study was obtained from the editorial team for the journal. None of the authors’ identification details were used during the analysis and the preparation of the paper.
